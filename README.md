This design was created during the 24 hour *Digital-Design Hackathon* which was held between the 1st of march17:00 to 2nd of march 17:00.

## Digital Design Hackathon 2019

The Hackathon evolved around a brief from a company called *AeroGuest*which is a digital hotel platform and app of the future, as they describe themselves. On their website, they write their vision behind AeroGuest, which is to recreate the relationship between hotel and guest and to optimize the way we travel through digitalization and IoT.

AeroGuest initiated the Hackathon with a short presentation in which they presented there app and the design brief

> “What kind of service can we offer a guest before, during or after their hotel stay that is commercially both relevant convenient and attractive?”

*Brainstorming phase with whiteboard and post-it’s for rapid idea-generation*

we started out with rapid post-it brainstorming, because we wanted to get all of our idea’s out of our heads by externalising them in the physical world. having a lot of idea’s is great when you are trying to get a grip on the design situation, however i feel sometimes that the amount of ideas we had was almost a little to overwhelming to work with at times.

The way we structured the brainstorm was to have the whiteboard divided into three sections before arriving at a hotel, during the stay at the hotel and after the hotel-stay. This acted as a way of categorizing different ideas or associations.

## Framing the design

As we progress further in the process we started to slowly frame the design problem that we were working with, by turning the perspective from the user of the app to the ones the app would make obsolete, the receptionists. When the brief was introduced they said that they aimed to make the hotel experience as easy and convenient as possible with as few interactions with staff as possible. One of the aims with the app was to minimize the contact between the guest and the receptionist. Reflecting on this matter along with the Aeroguest *“app of the future idea”* concept, we realized that we would need some more concrete data, In regards to **what it means to be a receptionist?** in order to progress further in the design process.

## Ethnographic study of receptionists

This resulted in a series of ethnographic qualitative interviews with four different receptionist at four different hotels or hostels. (Cabinn hotel Aarhus, Scandic Aarhus City, Hotel Ritz Aarhus City, Hostel City Sleep-In)

*Notes: Interviews with the receptionists*

The data we had gathered from the interviews was extremely valuable in our design process, due to fact that it gave us a first-hand insight into the life and practice of a receptionist. from the interviews, we concluded that the human contact between the guest and receptionist is very important especially in cases where the guest might have special needs or questions.

*AeroGuest “Here to Help”*

In AeroGuests app they had tried to accommodate this by having a 24-hour messaging service that would connect the guest directly to the receptionist called *“Here to Help”*.

However, having conducted the interviews with the receptionists, it was clear to us that the messaging service in the app would never be fully capable of replacing the caring, and physical human contact which is so important for having a good experience at the hotel.

## The Vision and Blackhat obstacle

At this point in the design process we constructed a vision for the design:

> “Keep the human relation between the guest and receptionist”

proceeding from the vision we went straight into a 635-brainstorming process with the aim to get a series of ideas and sketches that we could further consider working with. Having all of the 11 sketches we decided to converge to three sketches, and then change the location to the prototyping lab, with the intention to just start prototyping something.

In the last remaining hours of the design sprint we were extremely tired but nevertheless determined to work on finishing the design before the deadline of the Hackathon. Due to a high stress factor and uncertain or unclear concepts in how we should go about creating the design, we ended up critiquing our design idea to the point where no one wanted to build or in anyway continue. We encountered a blockage in our process 4 hours before deadline.

In order for us to regain control over the design process, we read about a concept called Black-hatting in *“Thoughtful Interaction Design”* by Jonas Löwgren and Erik Stolterman,and were able to classify our current phase as being negatively impacted by our black hat approach. Through extensive knowledge concerning this approach and a very helpful chat with a supervisor, we managed to start development on our prototype for the design challenge.

## Making the prototype

*Designing the Prototype*

The development of the prototype was quite hectic since we had about 1 hour and 30 minuttes to guild the prototype and prepare a 5 minute presentation of the design.

The prototype was constructed by laser-cutting transparent acrylic sheets that would then later be assembled into a box with a heart motif on the front.

*The template for laser-cutting the acrylic sheets into the box*

The box would then contain approximately 16 neopixels that would pulsate in a violet/pinkish color in a heartbeat like- rhythm. The pulsating motion would be controlled from an Arduino Uno.

## The Receptionist

*By Mark, Margrete, Helena, Martin and la Cour*

This design focuses on the increasingly digitalized hotel experience, within which the profession of human receptionist can become completely replaced through automated systems. The cube seeks to bring back the human relation into this future world of computational processing in order to argue for the importance of human contact. LED-strips are lined up against the back side within the box, an attached Arduino board is processing the pulsation of light, and baking paper is attached to all sides within the box in order to spread out the light more evenly. In a finalized version of the design a device will track the pulse from an employee of the hotel and send the data to the box.

with this design we won the Digital Design Hackathon 2019
