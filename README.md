*By Mark, Margrete, Helena, Martin and la Cour*

This design focuses on the increasingly digitalized hotel experience, within which the profession of human receptionist can become completely replaced through automated systems. The cube seeks to bring back the human relation into this future world of computational processing in order to argue for the importance of human contact. LED-strips are lined up against the back side within the box, an attached Arduino board is processing the pulsation of light, and baking paper is attached to all sides within the box in order to spread out the light more evenly. In a finalized version of the design a device will track the pulse from an employee of the hotel and send the data to the box.
